# Laravel + Vue 3 + Inertia Monolith â€” Starter Kit

A batteries-included starter for building a modern Laravel 12 app with a Vue 3 front end powered by Inertia.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS 4. It also ships with a helpful dev toolbox: Ziggy for routes in JS, Laravel Debugbar, Pail for live logs, Pest for testing, PHPStan for static analysis, and Pint for code style.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Install PHP deps
composer install

# 2) Copy env and set your DB credentials
cp .env.example .env

# 3) Generate app key
php artisan key:generate

# 4) Create the sqlite file
New-Item database/database.sqlite

# 5) Run database migrations + seeders
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# 6) Install JS deps
npm install

# 7) Start Vite in watch mode (one terminal)
npm run dev

# 8) Start the PHP server (second terminal)
php -S 0.0.0.0:80 -t public
# (Port 80 usually needs sudo; 8000 is safer for local dev.)

# Open the app
# http://localhost
```

**Note**: This project intentionally does not use Herd due to Google API constraints in some setups. The built-in PHP server or Sail works great.
